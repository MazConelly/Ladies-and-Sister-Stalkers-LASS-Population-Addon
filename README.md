The player model portion of the Ladies and Sister Stalkers (LASS) project built for G.A.M.M.A. Replaces the player outfits and first person legs with new female models.

LASS is a project I've been working on and off for about a total of a months work. A two part project to add more female variety to the zone, Ie; the Ladies and the Sister. This release covers the player. The second major release to be released in the future will be an overhaul of female NPCs with more variety in models. All lore friendly.

The mods primary effort can be seen with completely redone 3d models for the player character, and completely custom voice acting for both languages. Credited below.

This mod works best with [Warnymph](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/war-nymph)
You can always find the latest release from the the [github releases](https://github.com/Paint-Thinner/Ladies-and-Sister-Stalkers-LASS/releases) and install it by dragging it into MO2 at the bottom of the load order. Unlike otherwise, if you use WarNymph with the patch you need to have THAPS enabled.
If you find any bugs, with models etc...yell at me on the GAMMA discord or make a github ticket.
