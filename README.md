Model and Voice overhaul for all the player character models and first person leg models for female bodies.

LASS is a project I've been working on and off for about a total of a months work. A two part project to add more female variety to the zone, Ie; the Ladies and the Sister. This release covers the player. The second major release to be released in the future will be an overhaul of female NPCs with more variety in models.

This mod works best with Warnymph https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/war-nymph
Simply download the Sister.of.the.Zone.7z from the github release https://github.com/Paint-Thinner/Ladies-and-Sister-Stalkers-LASS/releases and install it by dragging it into MO2 at the bottom of the load order, see image below for compatibility with WarNymph

Unlike otherwise, if you use WarNymph with the patch you need to have THAPS
If you find any bugs, with models etc...yell at me
